        <h1>The Tiger and the Sloth</h1>
 
        <h2>Part 1</h2>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="sixty">
                There once was a Sloth, who was a little bit slow,<br>
                And a fearsome Tiger, would that Sloth come to know,<br>
                From across the forest, they gamed and swapped words,<br>
                Until the Tiger at last agreed to converge.<br>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="sixty">
                The Tiger and Sloth had a jolly good time,<br>
                The hills, the lakes, and even the country's outline!<br>
                And ofcourse when they traveled, the Tiger had it her way,<br>
                “If you were in charge of direction, we'd be dead in a day!”<br>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="sixty">
                But then the Sloth hurt his skin, and things started to sour,<br>
                And their differences meant they were easy to anger,<br>
                And the Sloth was lazy, enraging the Tiger more,<br>
                “Put in more effort, or I'll head for the door!”<br>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="sixty">
                But the Tiger stuck by him, for reasons unknown,<br>
                Within one another they had both found a home,<br>
                They completed the other, made up for each's flaws,<br>
                And help each other grow until they both had in-laws.<br>

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="sixty">
                They were a team after all, and neither would sway,<br>
                The Tiger and Sloth, on hay they would lay,<br>
                “Play with my hair!” the Tiger would say,<br>
                “Play with my hair like you did on that day!”<br>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="sixty">
                Their love for each other would not wither away,<br>
                And whoever messed with the duo would pay,<br>
                Their souls were bound tighter than a wedding bouquet,<br>
                And their bond would last longer than radioactive decay.<br>

                Hi Hannah,
                <br><br>
                I love you so much! I know I have a hard time showing my feelings or making you feel appreciated, but you are the best thing that's happened to my life and I love you so much.
                <br><br>
                You are so perfect I can't even describe it. You are beautiful and strong and the most morally pure and honest person I know and I don't always make it clear but I would never give this relationship up for anything in the world.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for putting up with all my shit! I know I'm not the easiest to hang out with and I take you for granted sometimes. I'm so sorry for the times I've lost my temper or when I have a sperg. I'm going to put in a lot of effort to keep my temperament and show a bit more 'decorum'.
                <br><br>
                I'm so excited to see what's ahead for us. Things will get better and better as we grow. Reverse honeymoon phase!
                <br><br>
                Happy 1 Year Anniversary!
                <br><br>
                Love x 1000000000,
                <br><br>
                Adrian
